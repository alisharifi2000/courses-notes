## 📖 Course Overview

Computer networks are the backbone of modern digital life, acting as the main arteries for information transfer. From daily communications to managing large enterprise systems, networks enable the continuous flow of vital data.

This course, taught by **Jadi Mirmirani**, is designed to provide a deep conceptual understanding of how networks function. Unlike courses that focus solely on memorizing commands, this 14-session journey focuses on the "Why" and "How," preparing you to understand complex structures, troubleshoot issues, and eventually manage network environments.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, I will have a solid understanding of:
* **Fundamental Concepts:** How data moves from point A to point B.
* **Protocols:** IP, DHCP, TCP/UDP, DNS, and NAT.
* **Addressing:** Subnetting and Routing.
* **Hardware:** Working with Switches, Routers, and Servers.
* **Practical Skills:** Setting up small to medium-sized networks and troubleshooting connectivity.

### Types of Networks
| Type | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LAN** | Local Area Network | Small scope (Home, Office). High speed, low cost. |
| **WAN** | Wide Area Network | Large geographical scope (Cities, Countries). The Internet is the biggest WAN. |
| **MAN** | Metropolitan Area Network | Covers a city or large campus. Between LAN and WAN. |
| **PAN** | Personal Area Network | Very short range (Bluetooth, Personal Hotspots). |

### Key Components
1.  **Server:** A powerful computer providing resources and data to the network.
2.  **Switch:** Connects devices within a single network (LAN) and directs traffic between them.
3.  **Router:** Connects different networks together (e.g., connecting a LAN to the Internet) and finds the best path for data.
4.  **Media:** The physical connection methods (Ethernet cables, Fiber optics, Wi-Fi).

### Common Certifications Mentioned
* **CompTIA Network+:** The standard entry-level certification for general networking principles.
* **CCNA (Cisco):** Focuses on Cisco equipment, switching, and routing.
* **MTCNA (MikroTik):** Focuses on MikroTik equipment, popular in specific markets.
